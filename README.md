# Overview

This project is a simple web-based To-Do List application built using JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them—all directly from the browser. The goal of this project was to improve my understanding of how JavaScript works in the browser, especially how it interacts with HTML elements using the DOM (Document Object Model).

I created this software to practice writing functions, handling user events like clicks, and dynamically updating content on the screen. I also wanted to explore how JavaScript uses array methods and how to keep the code clean and modular. Overall, this helped me gain more confidence in writing interactive features with JavaScript.
